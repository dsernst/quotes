  quote: Conflux of Eternity
  author: Thomas Carlyle
  source: Wikipedia
  more: Carlyle's expressive phrase for time, as in every moment of it a centre in which all the forces to and from eternity meet and unite, so that by no past and no future can we be brought nearer to Eternity than where we at any moment of Time are; the Present Time, the youngest born of Eternity, being the child and heir of all the Past times with their good and evil, and the parent of all the Future. By the import of which (see Matt. xvi. 27), it is accordingly the first and most sacred duty of every successive age, and especially the leaders of it, to know and lay to heart as the only link by which Eternity lays hold of it, and it of Eternity.

    Likewise, when Ilan or Tom (or anyone) stakes out a strong position, and even says 'I think we should do x', what they are REALLY saying is something more like 'Here's an idea for solving such-and-such problem. I think we should either do it, or, if you have a better idea, let's talk about why it's better and do it instead of my idea.'
    Don't worry about 'rocking the boat' as you push for what you think is right – capsize the boat if that's what you need to do to surface a problem.

  quote: When you see such beauty, what takes place? At that moment, the very majesty of a mountain makes you forget yourself. Right? Have you ever been in that position? When you have seen that you don't exist, only that grandeur exists.
  author: J. Krishnamurti
  date: January 31, 1982
  source: http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-daily-quote/20140519.php
  more: "Look at something which you have seen which is actually marvellously beautiful: a statue, a poem, a lily in the pond, or a well-kept lawn. And when you see such a piece of beauty - no, no, when you see such, not piece - when you see such beauty what takes place? At that moment, the very majesty of a mountain makes you forget yourself. Right? Have you ever been in that position? When you have seen that you don't exist, only that grandeur exists. But a few seconds later or a minute later the whole cycle begins, the confusion, the chatter. So beauty is where you are not. Have you understood this? Do you understand, sir? Oh, what a crowd! The tragedy of it. Truth is where you are not. Beauty, love is where you are not. Because we are not capable to look at this extraordinary thing called truth."

    This is your life, do what you love, and do it often.
    If you don’t like something, change it.
    If you don’t like your job, quit.
    If you don’t have enough time, stop watching tv.
    If you are looking for the love of your life, stop; they will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love.
    Stop over analyzing, life is simple.

    All emotions are beautiful, when you eat, appreciate every last bite.
    Open your mind, arms, and heart to new things and people, we are united in our differences.
    Ask the next person you see what their passion is, and share your inspiring dream with them.
    Travel often; getting lost will help you find yourself.

    Some opportunities only come once, seize them.
    life is about the people you meet, and the things you create with them so go out and start creating.
    Life is short. Live your dream and share your passion.

  quote: |
    It took thousands of years of human civilisation before we got relatively benign governments. Power structures are not inherently benign; they must constantly be pressured to prevent malignant people using them to leverage their actions.

    A non-authoritarian government is an historical anomaly. It's a ball balanced on top of a hill, pushed there by the deaths of millions, and kept there by the vigilance of those who care.

    Please start caring.

  quote: "Most people prefer to believe their leaders are just and fair even in the face of evidence to the contrary, because once a citizen acknowledges that the government under which they live is lying and corrupt, the citizen has to choose what he or she will do about it. To take action in the face of a corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones. To choose to do nothing is to surrender one's self-image of standing for principles. Most people do not have the courage to face that choice. Hence, most propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give moral cowards an excuse not to think at all."

  quote: Violence as a way of achieving racial justice is both impractical and immoral. It is impractical because it is a descending spiral ending in destruction for all. The old law of an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind. It is immoral because it seeks to humiliate the opponent rather than win his understanding; it seeks to annihilate rather than to convert. Violence is immoral because it thrives on hatred rather than love. It destroys community and makes brotherhood impossible. It leaves society in monologue rather than dialogue. Violence ends by defeating itself. It creates bitterness in the survivors and brutality in the destroyers.

    The example I like to give is back in the days of Roman numerals, basic multiplication was considered this incredibly technical concept that only official mathematicians could handle. But then once Arabic numerals came around, you could actually do arithmetic on paper, and we found that 7-year-olds can understand multiplication. It's not that multiplication itself was difficult. It was just that the representation of numbers — the interface — was wrong.
